# Research Findings: ZzpChat MVP

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Rationale**: 
- Unified full-stack development experience
- Built-in API routes for backend functionality
- Excellent TypeScript support and type safety
- Automatic code splitting and optimization
- Vercel deployment optimization for hosting
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Separate React + Express.js (more complex setup and deployment)
- Remix (smaller ecosystem, less third-party integrations)

### Database & ORM
**Decision**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe database access with auto-generated TypeScript types
- Excellent migration system for schema evolution
- Built-in query optimization and connection pooling
- Strong ACID compliance for financial data integrity
- Great developer experience with Prisma Studio
**Alternatives considered**:
- TypeORM (less type safety, more complex setup)
- MongoDB (less ACID compliance for financial data, no relational benefits)

### Authentication
**Decision**: NextAuth.js v4
**Rationale**:
- Built-in OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft for Outlook)
- Automatic session management and CSRF protection
- Database adapter support for user persistence
- Easy integration with Next.js App Router
- Extensible for custom providers
**Alternatives considered**:
- Auth0 (additional cost, vendor lock-in)
- Supabase Auth (vendor lock-in, less flexibility)

### AI Processing
**Decision**: OpenAI GPT-4 API
**Rationale**:
- Best-in-class natural language understanding
- Reliable API with good uptime and response times
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Supports both text and voice input processing
- Cost-effective for MVP scale
**Alternatives considered**:
- Claude API (fewer integration examples, different pricing)
- Local models (insufficient performance, complex deployment)

### WhatsApp Integration
**Decision**: WhatsApp Business API via Meta
**Rationale**:
- Official API with full feature support
- Webhook support for real-time message processing
- Voice message handling capabilities
- Rate limiting and spam prevention built-in
- Official documentation and support
**Alternatives considered**:
- WhatsApp Web scraping (violates Terms of Service)
- Telegram Bot API (different platform, user migration required)

### UI Framework
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first CSS for rapid development
- Excellent dark mode support
- Consistent design system with design tokens
- Radix UI provides accessible, unstyled components
- Great TypeScript integration
**Alternatives considered**:
- Material-UI (opinionated design, harder customization)
- Chakra UI (less mature ecosystem)

### Deployment Platform
**Decision**: Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend
**Rationale**:
- Vercel optimized for Next.js applications
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Edge functions for global performance
- Railway/Render for database and background services
- Cost-effective for MVP scale
**Alternatives considered**:
- AWS (more complex setup, higher cost)
- Netlify (less backend support)

## Integration Patterns

### WhatsApp Webhook Flow
1. Meta sends webhook to `/api/whatsapp/webhook`
2. Verify webhook signature for security
3. Process incoming message (text or voice)
4. Convert voice to text using OpenAI Whisper
5. Send to AI processing service
6. Execute AI-determined action
7. Send response back via WhatsApp API

### OAuth Integration Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Gmail" in integrations page
2. Redirect to Google OAuth consent screen
3. User grants permissions
4. Receive authorization code
5. Exchange code for access/refresh tokens
6. Store encrypted tokens in database
7. Test connection and display status

### AI Command Processing
1. Parse natural language input
2. Identify intent (create invoice, summarize emails, etc.)
3. Extract entities (amount, client name, etc.)
4. Validate required information
5. Execute action or request missing info
6. Provide confirmation or clarification

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time Targets
- WhatsApp message processing: <2 seconds
- Dashboard page load: <1 second
- AI command execution: <3 seconds
- Database queries: <100ms average

### Scalability Planning
- Database connection pooling with Prisma
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- CDN for static assets
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Queue system for background tasks

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Secure token storage with encryption
- Regular security audits
- Input validation and sanitization

### API Security
- Webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- CORS configuration
- API key rotation
- Audit logging for all operations

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with Jest for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests with Playwright for user flows
- Contract tests for external API integrations
- Visual regression tests for UI components

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks
- Automated dependency updates
- Code coverage reporting

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Performance monitoring with Vercel Analytics
- Database query monitoring with Prisma
- Uptime monitoring with external service

### Business Metrics
- User registration and retention
- WhatsApp message volume
- AI command success rates
- Feature usage analytics
- Revenue tracking per subscription tier
